In disaster response, access to critical information is key to mitigate risks and to better triage the unfolding situation. To better support disaster response, we will build upon the Rapid Damage Assessment (RDA) Collector solution (a deployed solution by Esri Canada Pacific Region and BC Housing), to develop an augmented reality Damage Assessment Viewer (DAV). </br>

The DAV will enable qualified damage assessment follow-up teams to use their devices to "point-and-know" at any assessed building quickly seeing the information collected by the RDA team. </br>

Our plan is to use the iOS Quartz release to build a native app in AppStudio developer edition. It will hang off of the deployed solution published in-partnership with BC Housing commission.
