Leading with our primary excuse, our team's name has a double meaning
as our project will most likely involve time-based data and event driven
processing in some fashion. Of course it will also feature an amazingly
compelling front end application that we will somehow find time to build!

## Our Technology Stack

While we are holding our cards close for the moment, we can tell you
that our solution will involve custom code, and will bring mapping
capabilities and other geospatial services powered by ArcGIS Online 
to bear inside a popular consumer-friendly business productivity
application-as-a-service that is freely available online.

The solution will almost certainly involve JavaScript and HTML based
front-end logic, applying responsive design to make it mobile-friendly.
It is also likely to involve a custom REST API that we use behind the
scenes. Finally, although we will leverage ArcGIS Online based services
wherever appropriate, there are likely to be some lightweight storage
needs that align better to a custom back-end.

We will use a general-purpose cloud such as Azure to host the browser
assets, custom REST endpoints and any internal storage needs that are
specific to our solution. Assuming we do go with Azure, we are leaning
strongly toward [ASP.NET Web API](http://www.asp.net/web-api) for the
web services.
