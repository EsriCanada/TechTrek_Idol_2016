# Team No Time (TNT)

Leading with our primary excuse, our team's name has a double meaning as our project will most likely involve involve temporal data capture and live up-to-date analysis, or other event driven processing in some fashion. Of course it will also feature an amazingly compelling front end application that we will somehow find time to build!
