<h2>Adding a little Geography to STEaM based learning!</h2>

<h4>STEaM based learning with a dash of Geography</h4>

Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math (STEaM) focused projects bring real world problem solving into the classroom.  When a student is directly impacted by the issue, the more likely they will remain engaged in the problem solving process.     

Adding Geography to the recipe presents a multitude of issues on local, national and global scales that impact everyone.  The observable world around us contains a wealth of accessible information ready to be analyzed.

As Geography professionals, it is important for us to provide the resources our school's need to be successful.

<h4>What is Project ArcNerds?</h4>

The goal of Project ArcNerds is to provide tutorials and tools for STEaM based projects that focus on Geography.  These resources can be used to recreate the project in the classroom.  Projects will include the following component's:

<ul>
<li>Data Collection and Storage</li>
<li>Visualization</li>
<li>Analysis</li>
<li>Application development</li>
</ul>

<h4>How's the Weather?</h4>

For our first project we decided to periodically upload data from a home-use Weather Station to an ArcGIS Online feature service.  Many Canadian school boards have ArcGIS Online Subscriptions already available to them.

  Using a small, affordable micro-computer called a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, freely available open source weather software called <a href="http://www.weewx.com/">WeeWx</a> and some python, we configured a weather station to periodically update an ArcGIS Online feature service

To visualize the data, we used the <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/web-appbuilder/">ArcGIS Web Application Builder</a> to code a few widgets in JavaScript and then created a website.  We currently have widgets to display up to date weather information as well as generate charts summarizing the data that has been collected for a specific station.

Once complete, we will put together some tutorials that can be used to repeat this project in the classroom.  For now, we've prepared a sample tutorial and uploaded it to our repository.
