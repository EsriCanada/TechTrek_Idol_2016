# ArcGIS Online Teams
## For those teams who don't need GitHub



1. [Apply to join this group](http://www.arcgis.com/home/group.html?id=baa732e41f5c4c5d8a1f349a233dc214) - you'll need an organizational account.
2. Share an "Application" item to this group as a placeholder so we know you've entered the contest (there's a sample submission in the group already)
3. When you're ready with your app, share it with this group.
